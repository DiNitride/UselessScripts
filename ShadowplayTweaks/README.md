# Shadowplay Tweaks

## Tools and Tweaks to help manage my collection of Shadowplay clips

## Open all streams VLC
Shadowplay records PC audio and mic audio to two separate audio tracks for editing. When viewing in VLC, options must be set at the command line to play both back simultaneously for previewing. The 90sec option additonally starts the video 90 seconds in, so I only have to view the last 30 (My clips are set to 2min length)

## Clip
Batch fil to open a Python script (Why not just open the Python script directly? Not sure tbh, must have been a dumb reason when I did it, but I don't care now) that allows me to automatically clip, rename, and move the clipped video into a project bin
