# UselessScripts
A collections of mildly sometimes useful scripts and tools that are only applicable for my own use probably

## Structure
Each script/topic goes inside it's own folder with a README.md
Line 1 of the README should be a H1 title of the script/topic
Line 3 of the README should be a H2 short description
